# Mangadex Update Notifier LINE Bot

(Unofficial) Mangadex update notifier for LINE.
Follow a manga and get notified every time there is an update on mangadex!

## How to use
1. Add bot by clicking [this](https://line.me/R/ti/p/@228kmsfw) link.
2. Start following a manga!

## Information
1. This bot only sends manga update with English language.
2. Bot (should) checks update every one minute.
3. When bot keep sending you a same update, it is a most likely that MangaDex itself is experiencing an issue, please bear with it for a moment (you can mute bot until it solves).
4. When you think there is an update but bot does not send a any update, there is a high chance that Push Messages Quota is exceeded, LINE limits the quota only 500 each month, there is no solution for this. If this happens, I will most likely set a limit for a total title that you can follow.
5. To prevent problem that mentioned in no. 4, for a time being, I set a a total registered user limit (total:15) so that I can see how many quota that will be spent each month and I can adjust the manga following limit or total registered user limit for later.
